# Genesis Prompt

## Intro

**Genesis Prompt** is a simple web app I built to explore how people can discover and share useful AI prompts in one place.

As AI tools grow, prompts are becoming just as important as the tools themselves. I wanted to build a lightweight platform where users can save, share, and explore prompts created by others.

## What This App Does

Genesis Prompt allows users to:

* Discover AI prompts shared by the community
* Create and share their own prompts
* Edit or delete their prompts
* Browse a simple public prompt feed

To keep things clean and secure, users authenticate before managing their prompts.

## How It Works (High Level)

1. Users sign in using authentication
2. Authenticated users can create AI prompts
3. Prompts appear in a shared feed
4. Users can update or delete their own prompts

The app focuses on simplicity and usability.
