# Giftchain

## Intro

**Giftchain** (Alternative of BuyMeACoffee / Patreon Platform)

I built **Giftchain** because I felt too high brokerage and middlemen in the way creators get support online.

When a supporter wants to send money to their favourite creator / Influencer, the money passes through many middlemen. They pay through card and pay card fees, platform fees etc.Creators who receive this fund they have holding periods, withdrawal limits — all of this slowly eats away at the support that was meant for the creator. Even after paying all the fees, creators often have to wait days or weeks to access their own money.

Giftchain is my attempt to fix this with blockchain ability to remove middlemen and fees.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a system where:

* Supporters know exactly where their money goes
* Creators receive support directly, without delays
* No platform can freeze, hold, or control creator funds
* Fees are minimal and transparent
* No holding periods or withdrawal limits

This isn't just another “Buy Me a Coffee” clone!

## The Problem Giftchain Solves

Traditional creator platforms (BuyMeACoffee, Patreon etc.):

* Take a cut from every payment (5% to 20%)
* Charge extra card and processing fees (1% to 2%)
* Hold creator funds until a minimum threshold is reached ($10)
* Control payouts and timelines (5-7 Days Waiting Period)

This creates a trust gap. Supporters think they are helping creators, but a thick part of the money never reaches them.

## How Giftchain Works (High Level)

Giftchain removes the middleman.

Instead of money flowing through a platform, payment gateways, or any other middlemen, payments go **directly from the supporter to the creator** using blockchain.

Here’s the simple flow:

1. A supporter chooses a creator and sends a gift as cryptocurrency
2. The payment goes directly to the creator’s wallet
3. The transaction is recorded on-chain and is fully transparent
4. The creator can access the funds instantly

No holding - No withdrawal limits - No hidden cuts
